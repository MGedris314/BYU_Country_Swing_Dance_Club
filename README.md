# Your startup name here

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here.

The application I plan on building will be a web page based around the Country Swing dance club here at BYU.  It will function in a few ways, the first will be more of a calandar that updates as the weeks go and it will mention the moves covered in instruction and the line dance taught.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Being a part of this club has been fun for the first semester, but I've also had a few moments over break and even in the semester where I couldn't remember some of the things we taught.  What I'm looking to accomplish with this website is to give refreshers for steps and moves taught durring certain week.  I also want it to say what the line dance(s) taught that week were, and if I can I'd like to link videos as they get uploaded.

### Design

This will be coming later when I understand how to use the mermaid language.

```

### Key features

- A semester long calandar that will update weekly with what is going to be taught/ what has been taught.
- A club comitee sign in option to update the calandar.
- Possibly videos/tutorials of certain dance steps; if that doesn't work, links to places that do.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Five different view ports.  Main page with schedule and lessons, Admin log in page, Video page, page for Admins to adjust the calandar, club information page.
- **CSS** - Help build out a country esc feel to the page.
- **React** - Roating views with a root to a single page, interaction to move back and forth between months and possible links to tutiorials.
- **Service** -  Authorizing committee members and make sure they are the only ones changing things on the calandar.
- **DB/Login** - Store log in info for the club committee.
- **WebSocket** - Give latest updates for lessons taught that week and who updated it.
